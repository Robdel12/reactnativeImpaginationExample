# Robot Impagination

This repo demostrates how to
use [Impagination.js](https://github.com/flexyford/impagination)
within a React Native project. Impagination is a lazy data layer for
your paged records. Basically it does the work for requesting data to
a paginated API.

### Development instructions

I've only tested this with iOS but I don't see any reason why this
wouldn't work with Android (knocks on wood).

These setup instructions assume you've already setup your environment
for React Native development. If you haven't done that I recommend
looking over
their
[getting started docs.](https://facebook.github.io/react-native/docs/getting-started.html)

- Clone the repo. `git clone
  git@github.com:Robdel12/robotImpagination.git`
- cd into the directory `cd robotImpagination`
- Install the dependencies `yarn`
- Open the project in xcode (the xcode file lives in the `ios` folder)
- Build the project
